# GuessingGame3 (workshop exercise)

This is the same version of the app GuessingGame2, however, it uses Flask framework. Now, the difference is that the
user has 3 buttons, with which they can give information to computer. Therefore, there is no need for validating the
input. The game ends after clicking correct or when computer runs out of tries, which happens only if the user cheated.
